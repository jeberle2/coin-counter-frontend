## CoinCounter Frontend
Angular 19

Runs with ```npm start``` at http://localhost:4200.
Uses the separate backend app "coin-counter-backend" at http://localhost:8080.

Due to time reasons only one test was written that shows the app is running.
Else there would be for each component tests and also for the TypeScript files with logic necessary.

In addition there would be some further steps necessary to remove logic from the components. 
Also a further separatoin in to additional components would be useful. Especially the app.component should hold less/no logic.
As mentioned in the code a propper error handling is missing for the backend-calls.
